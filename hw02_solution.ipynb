Thus, if in 2016 there is no error or fraud in election then in 2020, the probability of error or fraud is extremely small. The same situation in for the hypothesis of paragraph 12. For the hypothesis of paragraph 15, as stated by Cicchetti, \"the Georgia reversal in the outcome raises questions because the votes tabulated in the two time period oculd not be random samples from the same population of all votes cast\", since Georgia has a reversal in after Nov 4th, some people questioned the reversal, since they believed that it should have the same distribution as before Nov 4th, or there might be error or fraud in the reversal. Cicchetti used hypothesis of paragraph 15 to verified that two samples are not in the same distributions.\n",

        "4.   No. Even if rejecting the null hypotheses of paragraph 11 and paragraph 12, it does not imply that there are fraud or error in the election. One could not simply compare Clinton with Biden, since Biden might originally have more supporters than Clinton, or vice versa for the Trump side. If rejecting the null hypothesis of paragraph 15, it also does not mean there are fraud or error. The mail vote is usually much slower and due to covid-19, most Biden supporters choose to using mail to vote, thus they received later."

Since both 2016 and 2020 have Trump as a candidate, if 2020 is fraud or error, then the probability of fraud or error in 2016 is large. Thus, by accepting the null hypotheses of paragraph 11 and 12, one can strongly assert that the probability of fraud or error is small. And the hypothesis of paragraph 15 states that the reveral is also valid."
